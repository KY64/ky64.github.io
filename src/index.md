# Projects

These are the least that I could share publicly:

- **[Di Surabaya](https://di-surabaya.com/)**: Surabaya town guide for personal usage. It's built to save a lot of clicking, typing, 
  and scrolling to find specific information about Surabaya by collecting it in one page <sup>[[source](https://github.com/KY64/di-surabaya)]</sup>
- **[PIC (PNG Image Combinator)](https://ky64.codeberg.page/pic/)**: Combining multiple PNG images into a single image. Inspired by
  [HashLips](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine), this tool is a rewrite and trimmed down version to reduce memory usage
  when generating more than hundred of images.
- **[Python Trace ID Logger](https://github.com/KY64/correlation-logger)**: Python logging with trace ID support
