Gathering, sharing, listening, and playing.
Those are routine that makes life not boring
with others. Yet sometimes, those routine could
be exhausting for some people. There's a time
when being with others enjoyable, and there's a
chance when being alone is as much as enjoyable
when playing with others. It's interesting to
observe how people escape from boredom.
